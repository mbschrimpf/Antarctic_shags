The Poncet data say: ""In 2 groups on the N coast of an islet lying 2.5 nm WSW of Stayaway Skerries"" (Our best guess for that exact subcolony location: -64.7549, -64.3795). The Poncets also found a single nest in another place in the Joubin group a couple years later, but it was abandoned in the following season, so we did not include that nest in the total. More recently, W. Fraser (pers. comm.) indicated that the colony ""is still active, with a very rough estimate of 50-70 breeding pairs.  The colony is on a dome perhaps 150 feet above the water, so basically inaccessible without climbing gear -- hence the rough estimate."" While it's likely that the population estimate of 250 is probably closer to 50-70 now, it's also possible that there are other sites in the island group, so without a more recent comprehensive survey, we decided to use the older record."
